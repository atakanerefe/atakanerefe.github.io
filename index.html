                People keep asking, "Who is Atakan?" Well, the truth is, it is not a question with a single answer. 
                I’ve got different sides, each with its own story. 
                So, instead of trying to fit myself into one box, let me show you all the different Atakans that make me, me.

            <p class="fs-5">Education has been all about exploring different fields and merging multiple disciplines to create something brand new for me. 
                And it still is in a sense considering I am studying Computer Science and Music double major and Economics minor at Colby College.
                I’m basically a jack of all trades and, honestly, a master of quite a few of them. I code softwares,
                build electronics, compose and produce music, write songs, act on stage, volunteer.
                I am also knowledgable about psychology, history, science, art, politics, economics and, philosphy.
                Altough credit naturally goes to my educational background, my own curiosity and passion deserves a shout-out.

                From coding competitions in early middle school to building model satellites in highschool, tech was always a core part of my life.
                I think technology's practical side is what I love. 
                Understanding how nature and the world around us work is exciting yet the real magic happens when we use these concepts we learned to create something brand new.

                Growing up I always envisioned myself on stage and I still do.
                It has always been about inspiring people, helping them find themselves in my art as if that is my purpose.
                Especially children, because I was once that lonely kid strugling with the weight of world on his shoulders sitting alone depressed on his own.
                I know there are many kids out there who are going through their own struggles.
                Artists I love where there for me. I want to be their artist now.

            <p class="fs-5">
                Acting came as a suprise to me. I was always very interested in cinema and theatre as an art form. 
                Yet acting on stage never once crossed my mind.
                It was only after a creative-drama course I took, just to explore my interest.
                My insturctor told my family that I had gift in acting.
                After two years of acting classes and passing the acting exam, I found myself as a child actor in profesional adult casts.
                It came as a suprise but what a suprise it was.
                If it wasn't for acting, I would probably be just a consumer of art like most of us and even potentially never even find the courage to make my own music today.
